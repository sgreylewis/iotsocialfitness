## Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

In February 2018, Dish Network hosted a two-day IoT Hackathon for 10 teams at their
Meridian campus headquarters in Englewood, CO; the goal was to inspire Dish employees
and outside entrepreneurs, engineers, and data scientists to create and execute
an IoT product that would answer the question, "How can we make Meridian better
using IoT?"  Judged by a panel of executives, the teams would be competing for a
chance to obtain executive sponsorship for their product.  The specific goal for
each team was to "come up with a working demo of a thing that senses or acts(or
  both) in the physical world, controlled via the internet, using Alexa to make
  Meridian better."  The resources given to each team were:
  * Raspberry Pi 3
  * MicroSD Card
  * Pi Wedge
  * Sparkfun Inventor's Kit (photocell, motor, servo, resistors, jumper wires, LEDs,
    buttons)
  * Resistor
  * Breadboard
  * Echo Dot
  * Access to AWS back-end platform
  * $100 Visa gift card

  Each team was given a rubric that the judges would be using to judge us on, specifically
  in the categories of:
  * Feasability
  * Innovation
  * Utility
  * Presentation
